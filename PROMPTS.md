# üìã MAIN PROMPTS FOR DEVELOPMENT

This document contains the main prompts for efficiently working with development projects. Each prompt integrates essential project rules and is designed to guide our collaboration in a structured manner.

## 1. üîç Comparative Analysis

### Project Architecture Analysis

```prompt

- Respect the modular architecture (frontend/server/backend)
- Evaluate compatibility with existing systems and security

**Elements to analyze:**
- Code structure and organization
- Dependencies and integrations
- Performance and optimizations
- Security and permission management
- Potential improvement points

**Expected response format:**
1. Summary of the original implementation
2. Analysis of differences with current implementation
3. Impacts on performance and security
4. Concrete recommendations (without modifying code without validation)
5. Be as concise as possible and go straight to the answer.
```

## 2. üöÄ Development

```

## 3. üêõ Debugging

### Project Debugging

```prompt
I am encountering the following problem in our project: [PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION]

**Debugging rules to follow:**
- Analyze the root cause without immediately modifying the code
- First check the original implementation in the reference repository

- Clearly document the problem and its solution

**Problem information:**
- Observed behavior: [BEHAVIOR]
- Expected behavior: [EXPECTED]
- Context of occurrence: [CONTEXT]
- Logs/errors: [LOGS]

**Expected resolution process:**
1. Root cause analysis
2. Verification in the original code in the reference repository
3. Proposed solutions (in order of preference)
4. Test plan to validate the correction
5. Documentation of the correction
6. Be as concise as possible and go straight to the answer.
7. No modifications made without user validation.
```

## 4. ‚ö° Optimization

### Performance Optimization

```prompt
I would like to optimize the performance of [COMPONENT] in our project.

**Optimization rules to follow:**
- Do not compromise security or stability
- Maintain compatibility with the existing architecture
- Test each optimization individually
- Document performance gains
- Prioritize optimizations with the best impact/risk ratio

**Optimization context:**
- Current performance issue: [ISSUE]
- Current metrics: [METRICS]
- Technical constraints: [CONSTRAINTS]
- Improvement objectives: [OBJECTIVES]

**Expected analysis and plan:**
1. Detailed diagnosis of bottlenecks
2. Comparison with the original implementation
3. Proposed optimizations (in order of impact)
4. Test plan and performance validation
5. Documentation of optimizations
6. Be as concise as possible and go straight to the answer.
```

## 5. üé® User Interface

### UI/UX Improvement

```prompt
I would like to improve the user interface of [COMPONENT] in our project.

**UI/UX design rules to follow:**
- Maintain visual consistency with the rest of the application
- Respect the React architecture and existing components
- Prioritize accessibility and user experience
- Test on different screen sizes (responsive design)
- Clearly document proposed changes

**Current UI structure:**
- **Main navigation**: Sidebar with list of workspaces and settings
- **Main components**:
  - Sidebar (lateral navigation with workspaces and settings)
  - Container (conversation interface with history and input)
  - Modals (modal windows for various actions)
  - Settings (application settings)
- **Main pages**:
  - Main (home page)
  - Chat (chat interface)
  - Login (authentication)
  - Admin (user management, workspaces, etc.)
  - GeneralSettings (general settings)
- **UI libraries**:
  - Custom UI components (button, dropdown, input, table)
  - CSS framework for styling
  - Router for navigation

**Improvement context:**
- Target component: [COMPONENT]
- Current issues: [ISSUES]
- Improvement objectives: [OBJECTIVES]
- Technical constraints: [CONSTRAINTS]

**Expected proposal:**
1. Analysis of the current interface and its limitations
2. Mockups or detailed descriptions of proposed improvements
3. List of files to modify and components to create/adapt
4. Implementation plan with responsive considerations
5. Usability tests to perform
6. Documentation of modifications
7. Be as concise as possible and go straight to the answer
8. No modifications without explicit user validation
```
